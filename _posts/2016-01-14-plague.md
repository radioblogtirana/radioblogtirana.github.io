He is part of ‘’Ravebotta’’ dj crew since 6 years and active not just playing music but also organising events.
‘’Ravebotta’’ is composed by 5 djs, everyone specialised in his own way, from Chicago house to noise techno.

The philosophy behind ‘’Ravebotta’’ partys is to play intense drifting away sets, totally non commercial, booking smaller alternative djs.
The biggest partys are ’’Fluchtpunkt’’ (open airs and indoor) which also followed the concept of non commercial, including free entry and no fence outdoor.
